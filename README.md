# F4B Health Check : 

This microservice is designed to handle the health check of the conversion funnel. The project uses a monorepo structure with Yarn workspaces, containing two main components:

- **Front End:** The user interface.
- **Back End:** The microservice using Puppeteer for conversion funnel monitoring.

## Project Configuration

The root `package.json` is configured as follows:

```json
{
  "name": "F4B_health_check",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "front",
    "back"
  ],
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "a microservice to handle health check of the convertion funnel",
  "main": "index.js",
  "author": "TOLSBLK",
  "license": "MIT",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "concurrently \"yarn workspace back run start:dev\" \"yarn workspace front dev\""
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "concurrently": "^7.0.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "pm2": "^5.4.3"
  }
```
Workspaces
----------

### Front End

*   Contains the applicationâ€™s user interface.
*   Typically includes a floating action button (FAB) to trigger the monitoring of the conversion funnel.

### Back End

*   Houses the microservice logic.
*   Implements a Puppeteer script for automating browser actions and checking the conversion funnel.
*   Exposes API endpoints (e.g., `/api/monitor`) for triggering the funnel check.

* * *

Running the Project
-------------------

### Local Development

To run both the frontend and backend concurrently, execute the following command from the root directory:

bash

Copier

`yarn dev`

This command utilizes the `concurrently` package to run:
*   The backend development server with `yarn workspace back run start:dev`
*   The frontend development server with `yarn workspace front dev`

### Integration with Azure DevOps

When setting up your build or release pipeline in Azure DevOps, consider these steps:
1.  **Install Dependencies:**  
    Run `yarn install` at the root level to ensure all workspaces are properly linked.
    
2.  **Build and Test:**  
    Include tasks to build each workspace and run tests as necessary.
    
3.  **Deployment:**  
    Configure your deployment scripts to use PM2 for process management in production (for the backend), and deploy the frontend as required.
    
4.  **Environment Variables:**  
    Make sure to configure environment variables that your application may depend on for both development and production environments.

Additional Information
----------------------

*   **Conversion Funnel Monitoring with Puppeteer:**  
    Customize your Puppeteer script in the `/back` workspace to accurately capture and monitor funnel metrics.
    
*   **Process Management with PM2:**  
    The project uses PM2 to manage the backend process in production environments. Ensure PM2 is properly configured if you plan to deploy.
    
*   **Troubleshooting Tips:**
    *   If you encounter dependency issues, try running `yarn install --force`.
    *   Verify that the ports used by the front end and back end do not conflict with other running services.
